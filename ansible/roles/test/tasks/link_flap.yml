# This test is part of sswsyncd functionality tests.
#
# In this test, I try to iteratively shutdown and bring up physical interface
# from the DUT spine neighbor side by controlling the underlay fan-out switch.
# Then, I check the neighbor table to ensure certian entries are updated
# according to the certain link flappings.
